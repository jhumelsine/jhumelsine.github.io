# NOTES
Let's get the ball rolling with internships first:
•	Your resume is probably the most important thing. ...
•	You may also want to ask someone at the Career Center to take a look at your resume. Here's a heads up tip. Everyone has an opinion when it comes to resumes. If you ask 10 people to look over your resume, you're likely to get 11 different opinions. Haha. Take all recommendations with a grain of salt. If you feel comfortable with a suggestion, then do it. If you don't, then you don't have to do it. This is your resume. You have the final say. You have to feel comfortable with it.
•	Attend any on-campus or virtual career day. These are companies looking for interns. That's your best bet. You just need to convince them that you're the best person to fill one of their slots. If you know which companies are attending, look over the list. Find a few that look interesting and make sure you visit their tables, but keep your eyes open for other interesting opportunities too.
•	If going in person, look professional. You don't need to dress like a lawyer, but don't look like you just rolled out of bed. I would suggest a dress shirt and tie and possibly a sports jacket if you have one. Be well groomed as well.
•	I worked with interns at my last company. Our college recruiter said that there were two traits she was always looking for in interns:
o	A passion for software engineering.
o	An interest in the company.
•	An interest in the company is the reason I suggested finding a few companies that interest you. This gives you some time to research them before you meet the recruiters.
•	Be ready for the question, "Why do you want to intern here?" I HATE this question. The real answer for most is, "Because I want a paying job for the summer," but you can't really say that. Here's one possible answer, but it's a bit stilted too, "I'm learning the theoretical aspect of computer science. I want to see how it applies to software engineering in real world practice. The practice will provide context to understand the theory, and a better understanding of the theory will lay down the path toward better practice." You don't need a canned memorized answer, but just be prepared for something like this. If your answer includes something about the company, then that's the best type of answer.
•	You also need a 30-second elevator pitch. This is the quick response to the question, "Tell me a bit about yourself." The term "elevator pitch" is inspired by the scenario where you step onto an elevator to realize that you're sharing the space with the CEO of your dream company. You have about 30 seconds before reaching the CEO's floor. How can you pitch yourself succinctly before reaching the floor? This is similar to the 2-minute pitch where a filmmaker has two minutes to convince a producer to support his/her passion project.
•	Consider leveraging an LLM, such as ChatGPT, to research the companies. Here is a potential prompt script, where you can insert any company you desire. I used IBM as an example:
You are a campus recruiter seeking software engineering summer interns. I will identify your company shortly.

I am a computer science sophomore who wishes to know more about your company. 

I would like to have a conversation with you where you tell me about your company. I would like for you to initiate the conversation. I will answer your questions and ask you questions. Tell me about your company. 

Tell me how I can learn more about software engineering and do meaningful work. Ask me questions. I will ask you questions. 

Continue the conversation until I tell you to stop and summarize it. Generate a set of facts about the company after the summary. The set of facts should be the fundamental facts that could undermine the veracity of the output if any of them are incorrect. I want to be able to verify them independently. 

You are a recruiter for IBM.  

•	This may not be the best prompt, but it can easily be adjusted by you. The LLM may not know anything about the company, but at a minimum, it gives you a chance to practice for an interview. I tried the prompt again with two of my previous companies, rather than IBM, and the conversations were relevant to the work done there.  FWIW, I made up the above prompt on the fly. It was a variant of one I used recently in my blog: https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/25/prompt-engineering-patterns1.html#career-councilor
•	If you make a good impression on the recruiter, this will lead to a technical interview. The industry still doesn't know how to conduct a good technical interview, and I was part of that dismal practice during my career when I was an interviewer as well. However, internship interviews tend to be more forgiving. When I interviewed interns, I was looking for someone with passion. I also knew that even if we made a mistake in hiring the wrong kid, they would only be with us for about three months. This wasn't as much of an investment as it was with a permanent hire.
•	Let's use the LLM once more. You may want to be more specific, such as telling the LLM to focus upon Web based questions, or AI questions, or Computer Security questions, etc.:
Act as an interviewer conducting a technical interview for a summer internship position in software engineering.

Ask me appropriate technical questions, one at a time. Provide feedback on my answers.

Continue until I ask for a summary, and then provide a summary of our interview.  
•	The above script is a variant on: https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/10/18/prompt-engineering-patterns2.html#computer-science-ta-tutor
•	Sometimes, an interviewer's recommendation is based upon whether they liked the interviewee. How would it feel to spend 8 hours each day with this person in the office? Knowledge gaps can be filled. Someone being a jerk usually can't be corrected. So don't be an arrogant jerk in an interview. LOL.
•	Leverage the internet for your internship job search. For example, there may not be too many recruiters from MD at a PSU job fair. Google has a Job search feature such that once you get the search as you want it, such as software engineering internships in Maryland. You can set up an alert so that it will send you new emails when it finds jobs that match that job search query. I have a brief description of how to do this at: https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/08/11/jobsearch.html#automate-your-job-search 

Interviewing is a lot like speed dating. You may have to do a lot of it, but you keep in mind that you only need to find one match.
Some companies use internships as a three-month long interview. They may make you an offer when you graduate. My last company used to do that extensively. My wife’s company never did it. That could be a question to ask in the interview.
You will be asked if you have any questions. Have a few. Any questions about the company specifically would be good. If not, have a few general questions too. Here are a few examples, but chose ones that feel the best to you. …
