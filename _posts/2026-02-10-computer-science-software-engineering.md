# Introduction
I mentor several Computer Science undergraduates attending the university where I received my Bachelors in Computer Science almost 45 years ago.

Many of them ask me the same questions about internships, getting their first job and onboarding. Addressing these questions will be my next series about your career. I think the final blog entry of the series already exists, which I wrote about a year and a half ago with [Losing Your Job Stinks](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/08/11/jobsearch.html).

This series won't be as technical as other blogs. It will represent my own opinions career development and I know that many others will have their own opinions as well. My opinions may be out of date, since [Generative AI](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/18/llm-genai.html) was just coming onto the scene when I retired in 2023.

I plan to include the following in this series. This is just a working list. None of these are set in stone yet:
* Getting an Internship (TBD)
* Getting Your First Job (TBD)
* Onboarding (TBD)
* Your Career Journey (TBD)
* [Losing Your Job Stinks](TBD)
* Retiring (TBD)

# Complete Demo Code
Here’s the entire implementation up to this point as one file. Copy and paste it into a Java environment and execute it. If you don’t have Java, try this [Online Java Environment](https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/online-compiler/). Play with the implementation. Copy and paste the code into Generative AI for analysis and comments.

# NOTES
Computer Science is how to get the computer to do what you want. Software Engineering is how a group decides what they want the computer to do and how to convey that to others. Software Engineering is about communication with others. It's a social science.
There's a distinction between Computer Science and Software Engineering. I don't know that they necessarily convey that distinction well at universities these days. I think it's getting better with SE courses, but I don't think academia has a full grasp on CS vs SE quite yet. Maybe I'm wrong.

"In science if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it. In engineering if you do not know what you are doing you should not be doing it," by Richard Hamming

CS and SE are related yet different. Computer Science is to Software Engineering and Chemistry is to Chemical Engineering. They have a lot in common, but the former of the pair is about the science and the latter is about the application.

Computer Science addresses well defined problems of bounded scope/domain that don't tend to change over time. These problems tend to have provable solutions. I'm specifically thinking of things like data structures, algorithms, discrete mathematics, programming language design, etc.

Software Engineering addresses vaguely defined problems of fuzzier scope/domain that do tend to change over time. These problems tend to have testable solutions. I'm specifically thinking of applications that paying customers request.

Computer Science is how we get the computer to do what we want it to do.

Software Engineering is how we get the computer to do what we think our customer wants it to do, and do it in such a way so that we or others on our team can easily change it when the customer sees what we've provided and they tell us that what we got the computer to do isn't exactly what they wanted it to do.

Computer Science is a hard science. Its hard science cousin would be mathematics.

Software Engineering is a soft science. It's about working with other people to solve problems often with computers. Its soft science cousin would be sociology, with maybe a bit of economics mixed in.
