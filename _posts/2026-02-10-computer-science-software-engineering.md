# Introduction
I mentor several Computer Science undergraduates attending the university where I received my Bachelors in Computer Science almost 45 years ago.

Many of them ask me the same questions about internships, getting their first job and onboarding.
Addressing these questions will be my next series about your career.
I think the final blog entry of the series already exists, which I wrote about a year and a half ago with [Losing Your Job Stinks](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/08/11/jobsearch.html).

This series won't be as technical as other blogs.
It will represent my own opinions career development and I know that many others will have their own opinions as well.
My opinions may be out of date, since [Generative AI](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/18/llm-genai.html) was just coming onto the scene when I retired in 2023.

I plan to include the following in this series. This is just a working list. None of these are set in stone yet:
* Getting an Internship (TBD)
* Getting Your First Job (TBD)
* Onboarding (TBD)
* Your Career Journey (TBD)
* [Losing Your Job Stinks](TBD)
* Retiring (TBD)

# Computer Science is not Software Engineering
My degrees are in [**Computer Science**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science).
My mentees' degrees will be in **Computer Science**. But what we practice in industry is [**Software Engineering**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering).

Computer Science and Software Engineering are related yet different.
***Computer Science is to Software Engineering and Chemistry is to Chemical Engineering***.
They have a lot in common, but the former of the pair is about the science and the latter is about the application.

Computer Science is how to get the computer to do what you want it to do.
Software Engineering is how a group of people get the computer to do what they think the customer wants the computer to do in such a way that they can easily change it when the customer tells them that what it does isn't what they wanted.

Computer Science is about technology and mathematical rigor.
Software Engineering is about communication with others. It's a social science.

One needs some degree of Computer Science to practice Software Engineering.
They are related yet different disciplines.
I don't know that academia necessarily conveys that distinction well at universities these days.
I think it's getting better with Software Engineering courses, but I don't think academia has a full grasp on on the distinction between Computer Science vs Software Enginering quite yet.
Maybe I'm wrong.
I hope so.

_In science if you know what you are doing you should not be doing it. In engineering if you do not know what you are doing you should not be doing it._ — Richard Hamming

Computer Science addresses well defined problems of bounded scope/domain that don't tend to change over time. These problems tend to have provable solutions. I'm specifically thinking of things like data structures, algorithms, discrete mathematics, programming language design, etc.

Software Engineering addresses vaguely defined problems of fuzzier scope/domain that do tend to change over time. These problems tend to have testable solutions. I'm specifically thinking of applications that paying customers request.

Computer Science is how we get the computer to do what we want it to do.

Software Engineering is how we get the computer to do what we think our customer wants it to do, and do it in such a way so that we or others on our team can easily change it when the customer sees what we've provided and they tell us that what we got the computer to do isn't exactly what they wanted it to do.

Computer Science is a hard science. Its hard science cousin would be mathematics.

Software Engineering is a soft science. It's about working with other people to solve problems often with computers. Its soft science cousin would be sociology, with maybe a bit of economics mixed in.
