# Introduction
[Jon Bentley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley_(computer_scientist)) wrote a series of articles in the **Communications of ACM** in the 1980s called _Programming Pearls_. He bundled those articles into two books of the same title.

One of my favorite articles was [Bumper-Sticker Computer Science](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs100/Bentley_BumperSticker.pdf) published in September 1985. It's filled with pithy quotes by those in the industry almost 40 years ago. It's still a great read, and many of the quotes are as valid (and some sadly ignored) today as they were back then. I highly recommend it..

I've always liked quotes and some Computer Scientists and Software Engineers do know how to craft a good phrase.

Inspired by Bentley, I'm going provide my own set of Bumper Sticker Computer Science and Software Engineering, which includes some of my favorites from Bentley's original article. I hope some of those make you laugh, maybe cry and definitely think.

# Philosophy

_Give someone a program, you frustrate them for a day; teach them how to program, you frustrate them for a lifetime._ — David Leinweber

_What programming continuously teaches me is that asking the right questions is infinitely more important than writing the code._ — @DanielMiessler

_The Programmers' Credo: We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy._ — Anonymous

_Make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast. 90 percent of the time, if you make it beautiful, it will already be fast. So really, just make it beautiful!_ — Joe Armstrong

_I’m not a great programmer. I’m just a good programmer with great habits._ – Kent Beck

_Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind._ — Donald Knuth

_Why are video games so much better designed than office software? Because people who design video games love to play video games. People who design office software look forward to doing something else on the weekend._ — Ted Nelson

_A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable._ — Leslie Lamport

_We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins._ — Ellen Ullman

# Design

_One particular talent stands out among the world-class programmers I’ve known—namely, an ability to move effortlessly between different levels of abstraction._ — Donald Knuth

_The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise._ — Edsger Dijkstra

_At a certian level of abstraction, all complex systems are message passing systems. ... Genes are one mechanism that life uses to pass information across time; memes are one mechanism that societies use to pass information across time._ — Grady Booch

_To become experts at managing complexity, we need the following: Modularity Cohesion Separation of Concerns Abstraction Loose Coupling._ ― David Farley

_Strive to add function by deleting code._ — Jon Bentley

_The mark of a mature programmer is willingness to throw out code you spent time on when you realize it's pointless._ – Bram Cohen

_UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity._ — Dennis Ritchie

_In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away._ — Ross Callon in the fantastic RFC 1925

_I have always wished for my computer to be as easy to use as my telephone. My wish has come true because I can no longer figure out how to use my telephone._ – Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++

_There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult._ ― C. A. R. Hoare

_Folk wisdom in software development teaches that interfaces shouldn't be unduly influenced by implementations. Writing a test first is a concrete way to achieve this separation._ ― Kent Beck

# Implementation

_Allocate four digits for the year part of a date: a new millenium is coming._ — David Martin (Published as early as 1985)

_A procedure should fit on a page._ — David Tribble

_... the best programs are the ones written when the programmer is supposed to be working on something else._ — Melinda Varian

_Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares._ – Michael Feathers

_There’s nothing more permanent than a temporary hack._ — Kyle Simpson

_Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand._ — Martin Fowler

_Writing software as if we are the only person that ever has to comprehend it is one of the biggest mistakes and false assumptions that can be made._ — Karolina Szczur

_The strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything. The weakness is that you will._ — Reg Braithwaite

_Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them._ — Ron Jeffries

_Write code as if you had to support it for the rest of your life._ ― Kevlin Henney

_Well designed and written code doesn't require much maintenance. Software developers are constantly thrust into the poorly designed and written code to fix bugs and add new features. Thus is our curse. We're constantly exposed to bad code but rarely good code._ ― Jim Humelsine

_Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships._ ― Linus Torvalds

_TDD applies a pressure to create code that is objectively “higher quality.” This is irrespective of the talent or experience of the software developer. It doesn’t make bad software developers great, but it does make “bad software developers” better and “great software developers” greater._ ― David Farley

_Legacy code isn't the problem. It's all the technical debt in the legacy code that's the problem._ ― Jim Humelsine

# Prevention

_Rarely is anyone thanked for the work they did to prevent the disaster that didn’t happen._ – Mikko Hypponen

_A good lifeguard never gets wet. A bad lifeguard gets his name in the paper._ – My RedCross Lifeguard Instructor when I was as teenager

# Documentation

_If the code and the comments disagree, then both are probably wrong._ — Norm Schryer

_A common fallacy is to assume authors of incomprehensible code will be able to express themselves clearly in comments._ – Kevlin Henney

_Code never lies, comments sometimes do._ — Ron Jeffries

_If your code needs comments, consider refactoring it so it doesn’t._ ― Kevlin Henney

# Testing and Debugging

_Testing can show the presence of bugs, but not their absence!_ — Edsger W. Dijkstra 

_If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in._ ― Edsger W. Dijkstra

_The first step in fixing a broken program is getting it to fail repeatably._ — Tom Duff

_Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer._ — @fortes

_Hardware eventually fails. Software eventually works._ – Michael Hartung

_Our end users are our best and most expensive testers._ – Jim Humelsine

_Test-driven development is double-entry bookkeeping._ – Bob Martin

_The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do._ – Andrew Singer

for the other 90 percent of the development time._ — Tom Cargill
