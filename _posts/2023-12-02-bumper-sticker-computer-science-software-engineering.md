# Introduction
[Jon Bentley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley_(computer_scientist)) wrote a series of articles in the **Communications of ACM** in the 1980s called _Programming Pearls_. He bundled those articles into two books of the same title.

One of my favorite articles was [Bumper-Sticker Computer Science](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs100/Bentley_BumperSticker.pdf) published in September 1985. It's filled with pithy quotes by those in the industry almost 40 years ago. It's still a great read, and many of the quotes are as valid (and some sadly ignored) today as they were back then. I highly recommend it..

I've always liked quotes and some Computer Scientists and Software Engineers do know how to craft a good phrase.

Inspired by Bentley, I'm going provide my own set of Bumper Sticker Computer Science and Software Engineering, which includes some of my favorites from Bentley's original article. I hope some of those make you laugh, maybe cry and definitely think.

# Philosophy

_Give someone a program, you frustrate them for a day; teach them how to program, you frustrate them for a lifetime._ — David Leinweber

_What programming continuously teaches me is that asking the right questions is infinitely more important than writing the code._ – @DanielMiessler

_Programmer’s motto: “We’ll cross that bridge when it’s burning underneath us.”_ – @garybernhardt

_The Programmers' Credo: We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy_ — Anonymous

_Make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast. 90 percent of the time, if you make it beautiful, it will already be fast. So really, just make it beautiful!_ – Joe Armstrong

_I’m not a great programmer. I’m just a good programmer with great habits._ – Kent Beck

_Rarely is anyone thanked for the work they did to prevent the disaster that didn’t happen._ – Mikko Hypponen

_Some of those firefighters were also the arsonists._ – Dave T., coworker and friend, who whispered this to me at a Department Meeting after several developers were given The Firefighter Award by our Department Head for their heroric efforts in fixing issues in production.

_A good lifeguard never gets wet. A bad lifeguard gets his name in the paper._ – My RedCross Lifeguard Instructor when I was as teenager

_Learning to program teaches you how to think. Computer science is a liberal art._ – Steve Jobs

_One particular talent stands out among the world-class programmers I’ve known—namely, an ability to move effortlessly between different levels of abstraction._ — Donald Knuth

_The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise._ — Edsger Dijkstra

_At a certian level of abstraction, all complex systems are message passing systems. ... Genes are one mechanism that life uses to pass information across time; memes are one mechanism that societies use to pass information across time._ — Grady Booch

_Just because you've implemented something doesn't mean you understand it._ — Brian Cantwell Smit

_Induction makes you feel guilty for getting something out of nothing ... but it is one of the greatest ideas of civilization._ — Herbert Wilf

_I am worried that algorithms are getting too prominent in the world._ — Donald Knuth

_About 1,000 instructions is a reasonable upper limit for the complexity of problems now envisioned._ — John von Neumann, 1946

_Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out._ — Chris Pine

_In programming the hard part isn’t solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve._ — Paul Graham

_The manager's function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work._ – Tom DeMarco

_The purpose of software engineering is to control complexity, not to create it._ – Pamela Zave

_The best thing about a boolean is even if you are wrong, you are only off by a bit._ – Anonymous

_Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you. I'm happy to share what I can, because I'm in it for the love of programming._ — John Carmack

_In programming, if someone tells you “you’re overcomplicating it,” they’re either 10 steps behind you or 10 steps ahead of you._ — Andrew Clark

_Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind._ — Donald Knuth

_Why are video games so much better designed than office software? Because people who design video games love to play video games. People who design office software look forward to doing something else on the weekend._ — Ted Nelson

_Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday’s code._ — Dan Salomon

_Programming is not about typing, it's about thinking._ — Rich Hickey

_The smartest thing you can do as a programmer is realize how stupid you are, and make accommodations._ — Jason Swett

_Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it._ — Patrick McKenzie

_Telling a programmer there's already a library to do X is like telling a songwriter there's already a song about love._ — Pete Cordell

_Becoming a good engineer is about collecting experience. Each project, even small ones, is a chance to add new techniques and tools to your toolbox._ — Addy Osmani

# Planning

_The sooner you start to code, the longer the program will take._ — Roy Carlson

_Furious activity is no substitute for understanding._ — H. H. Williams 

_Weeks of coding can save you hours of planning._ – Unknown

# Requirements

_The act of describing a program in unambiguous detail and the act of programming are one and the same._ — Kevlin Henney

_Much of the essence of building a program is in fact the debugging of the specification._ – Fred Brooks

_Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen._ — Edward V Berard

# Architecture

_A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable._ — Leslie Lamport

_We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins._ — Ellen Ullman

# Design

_[One Page Principle] A (specification, design, procedure, test plan) that will not fit on one page of 8.5-by-1l.1 inch paper cannot be understood._ — Mark Ardis 

_Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships._ — Linus Torvalds

_Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration._ — Stan Kelly-Bootle

_If it’s your decision, it’s design; if not, it’s a requirement._ – Alistair Cockburn

_Inside every large program is a small program trying to get out._ – Tony Hoare

_Unix is user-friendly; it's just picky about who its friends are._

_So much complexity in software comes from trying to make one thing do two things._ – Ryan Singer

_All problems in CS can be solved by another level of indirection, except for the problem of too many layers of indirection._ — David Wheeler

_Strive to add function by deleting code._ — Jon Bentley

_The mark of a mature programmer is willingness to throw out code you spent time on when you realize it's pointless._ – Bram Cohen

_Whenever possible, steal code._ — Tom Duff

_Eschew clever rules._ — Joe Condon 

_For each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change_ – Kent Beck

_Make it correct, make it clear, make it concise, make it fast. In that order._ – Wes Dyer

_... the best programs are the ones written when the programmer is supposed to be working on something else._ — Melinda Varian

_Good Programming is not learned from generalities, but by seeing how significant programs can be made clean, easy to read, easy to maintain and modify, … . Careful study and imitation of good programs leads to better writing._ — Kernighan and Plauger

_Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares._ – Michael Feathers

_There’s nothing more permanent than a temporary hack._ — Kyle Simpson

# Performance

_The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state._ – John Ousterhout

_No matter how slow you are writing clean code, you will always be slower if you make a mess._ — Bob Martin

# Scheduling

_[Rule of Credibility] The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts
for the other 90 percent of the development time._ — Tom Cargill
