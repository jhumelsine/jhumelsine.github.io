# Introduction
[Jon Bentley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley_(computer_scientist) wrote a series of articles in the **Communications of ACM** in the 1980s called _Programming Pearls_. He bundled those articles into two books of the same title.

One of my favorite articles was [Bumper-Sticker Computer Science](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs100/Bentley_BumperSticker.pdf) published in September 1985. It's filled with pithy quotes by those in the industry almost 40 years ago. It's still a great read, and many of the quotes are as valid (and some sadly ignored) today as they were back then. I highly recommend it, and I'll be dropping a few of my favorites here.

I've always liked quotes some Computer Scientists and Software Engineers do know how to craft a good phrase.

Inspired by Bentley, I'm going to take a little fun and provide my own set of Bumper Sticker Computer Science and Software Engineering. I hope some of those make you laugh, maybe cry and definitely think.
