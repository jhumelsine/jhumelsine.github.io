# Introduction
[Jon Bentley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley_(computer_scientist) wrote a series of articles in the **Communications of ACM** in the 1980s called _Programming Pearls_. He bundled those articles into two books of the same title.

One of my favorite articles was [Bumper-Sticker Computer Science](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs100/Bentley_BumperSticker.pdf) published in September 1985. It's filled with pithy quotes by those in the industry almost 40 years ago. It's still a great read, and many of the quotes are as valid (and some sadly ignored) today as they were back then. I highly recommend it, and I'll be dropping a few of my favorites here.

I've always liked quotes some Computer Scientists and Software Engineers do know how to craft a good phrase.

Inspired by Bentley, I'm going to take a little fun and provide my own set of Bumper Sticker Computer Science and Software Engineering. I hope some of those make you laugh, maybe cry and definitely think.

# RAW NOTES

_Allocate four digits for the year part of a date: a new millenium is coming._ — David Martin

_The sooner you start to code, the longer the program will take._ — Roy Carlson

_If the code and the comments disagree, then both are probably wrong._ — Norm Schryer

_A procedure should fit on a page._ — David Tribble

_Testing can show the presence of bugs, but not their absence._ — Edsger W. Dijkstra 

_The first step in fixing a broken program is getting it to fail repeatably._ — Tom Duff

_The fastest algorithm can frequently be replaced by one that is almost as fast and much easier to understand._ — Douglas W. Iones 

_[One Page Principle] A (specification, design, procedure, test plan) that will not fit on one page of 8.5-by-1l.1 inch paper cannot be understood._ — Mark Ardis 

_[Rule of Credibility] The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts
for the other 90 percent of the development time._ — Tom Cargill 

_Whenever possible, steal code._ — Tom Duff

_Furious activity is no substitute for understanding._ — H. H. Williams 

_Eschew clever rules._ — Joe Condon 

_Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen._ — Edward V Berard

_The act of describing a program in unambiguous detail and the act of programming are one and the same._ — Kevlin Henney

_Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships._ — Linus Torvalds

_Give someone a program, you frustrate them for a day; teach them how to program, you frustrate them for a lifetime._ — David Leinweber

_Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer._ — @fortes

_A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable._ — Leslie Lamport

_Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration._ — Stan Kelly-Bootle

_Hardware eventually fails. Software eventually works._ – Michael Hartung

_What programming continuously teaches me is that asking the right questions is infinitely more important than writing the code._ – @DanielMiessler

_Our end users are our best and most expensive testers._ – Jim Humelsine

_Programmer’s motto: “We’ll cross that bridge when it’s burning underneath us.”_ – @garybernhardt

_The Programmers' Credo: We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy_ 

_Make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast. 90 percent of the time, if you make it beautiful, it will already be fast. So really, just make it beautiful!_ – Joe Armstrong

_For each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change_ – Kent Beck

_If it’s your decision, it’s design; if not, it’s a requirement._ – Alistair Cockburn

_I’m not a great programmer. I’m just a good programmer with great habits._ – Kent Beck
