# Introduction
[Jon Bentley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Bentley_(computer_scientist)) wrote a series of articles in the **Communications of ACM** in the 1980s called _Programming Pearls_. He bundled those articles into two books of the same title.

One of my favorite articles was [Bumper-Sticker Computer Science](https://moss.cs.iit.edu/cs100/Bentley_BumperSticker.pdf) published in September 1985. It's filled with pithy quotes by those in the industry almost 40 years ago. It's still a great read, and many of the quotes are as valid today as they were back then. And sadly, some are just as ignored. I highly recommend it.

I've always liked quotes, and some Computer Scientists and Software Engineers do know how to craft a good phrase.

Inspired by Bentley, I'm going provide my own set of Bumper Sticker Computer Science and Software Engineering, which includes some of my favorites from Bentley's original article. I hope some of these make you laugh, maybe cry and definitely think.

# Philosophy

_Give someone a program, you frustrate them for a day; teach them how to program, you frustrate them for a lifetime._ — David Leinweber

_Programmer’s motto: “We’ll cross that bridge when it’s burning underneath us.”_ — @garybernhardt

_The Programmers' Credo: We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy._ — Anonymous

_On two occasions I have been asked, 'Pray, Mr. Babbage, if you put into the machine wrong figures, will the right answers come out?' I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question._ ― Charles Babbage

_Make it work, then make it beautiful, then if you really, really have to, make it fast. 90 percent of the time, if you make it beautiful, it will already be fast. So really, just make it beautiful!_ — Joe Armstrong

_Make it work, make it right, make it fast._ — Kent Beck

_Make it correct, make it clear, make it concise, make it fast. In that order._ — Wes Dyer

_I’m not a great programmer. I’m just a good programmer with great habits._ — Kent Beck

_[A] computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter._ — Eric Raymond

_Just because you've implemented something doesn't mean you understand it._ — Brian Cantwell Smit

_You see, programmers tend to be arrogant, self-absorbed introverts. We didn’t get into this business because we like people._ ― Robert C. Martin

_Programming is a social activity._ ― Robert C. Martin

_We might even invent laws for series or formula in an arbitrary manner, and set the engine to work upon them, and thus deduce numerical results which we might not otherwise have thought of obtaining; but this would hardly perhaps in any instance be productive of any great practical utility, or calculated to rank higher than as a philosophical amusement._ — Ada Lovelace

_Induction makes you feel guilty for getting something out of nothing ... but it is one of the greatest ideas of civilization._ — Herbert Wilf

_I am worried that algorithms are getting too prominent in the world._ — Donald Knuth

_About 1,000 instructions is a reasonable upper limit for the complexity of problems now envisioned._ — John von Neumann, 1946

_Programming isn't about what you know; it's about what you can figure out._ — Chris Pine

_In programming the hard part isn’t solving problems, but deciding what problems to solve._ — Paul Graham

_The manager's function is not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work._ — Tom DeMarco

_There are 10 types of people in the world, those who can read binary, and those who can't._ — Anonymous

_Programming is not a zero-sum game. Teaching something to a fellow programmer doesn't take it away from you. I'm happy to share what I can, because I'm in it for the love of programming._ — John Carmack

_Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind._ — Donald Knuth

_Why are video games so much better designed than office software? Because people who design video games love to play video games. People who design office software look forward to doing something else on the weekend._ — Ted Nelson

_Programming is not about typing, it's about thinking._ — Rich Hickey

_The smartest thing you can do as a programmer is realize how stupid you are, and make accommodations._ — Jason Swett

_Every great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it._ — Patrick McKenzie

_Telling a programmer there's already a library to do X is like telling a songwriter there's already a song about love._ — Pete Cordell

_The computing scientist’s main challenge is not to get confused by the complexities of his own making._ ― Edsger W. Dijkstra

_Good judgement comes from experience, and experience comes from bad judgement._ ― Attributed to many

_Experience is a cruel teacher because she gives you the test first, the lesson afterwards._ ― Vernon Law

_You haven’t mastered a tool until you understand when it should not be used._ ― Kelsey Hightower

_In software development, “perfect” is a verb, not an adjective. There is no perfect process. There is no perfect design. There are no perfect stories. You can, however, perfect your process, your design, and your stories._ ― Kent Beck

_All programmers are optimists._ ― Frederick P. Brooks Jr.

_In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are not._ ― Attributed to many

_The best theory is inspired by practice. The best practice is inspired by theory._ ― Donald Knuth

_Theory is when you know something, but it doesn't work. Practice is when something works, but you don't know why. Programmers combine theory and practice: Nothing works and they don't know why._ ― Anonymous

_Sometimes the problem is to discover what the problem is._ ― Frederick P. Brooks Jr.

_Not “can we build it?” but “should we build it?_ ― Jez Humble

_The first step of any project is to grossly underestimate its complexity and difficulty._ ― Nicoll Hunt

_... crucial discoveries always emerge during the design/implementation effort._ ― Eric Evans

_Some folks think that Agile is about going fast. It’s not. It’s never been about going fast. Agile is about knowing, as early as possible, just how screwed we are._ ― Robert C. Martin

# Requirements

_The act of describing a program in unambiguous detail and the act of programming are one and the same._ — Kevlin Henney

_Much of the essence of building a program is in fact the debugging of the specification._ — Fred Brooks

_Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen._ — Edward V Berard

_If it’s your decision, it’s design; if not, it’s a requirement._ — Alistair Cockburn

# Architecture

_A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn’t even know existed can render your own computer unusable._ — Leslie Lamport

_We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins._ — Ellen Ullman

_Software and cathedrals are much the same — first we build them, then we pray._ — Anonymous

_If a change to the requirements breaks your architecture, then your architecture sucks._ ― Robert C. Martin

_If you think good architecture is expensive, try bad architecture._ — Brian Foote and Joseph Yoder

_Good architecture makes the system easy to understand, easy to develop, easy to maintain, and easy to deploy. The ultimate goal is to minimize the lifetime cost of the system and to maximize programmer productivity._ ― Robert C. Martin

_Architecture is the decisions that you wish you could get right early in a project, but that you are not necessarily more likely to get them right than any other._ — Ralph Johnson

_The first concern of the architect is to make sure that the house is usable — not to ensure that the house is made of bricks._ ― Robert C. Martin

_Architecture is a hypothesis, that needs to be proven by implementation and measurement_ — Tom Gilb

_The tragedy is that the architects, by making a premature decision, multiplied the development effort enormously._ ― Robert C. Martin

_At a certian level of abstraction, all complex systems are message passing systems. ... Genes are one mechanism that life uses to pass information across time; memes are one mechanism that societies use to pass information across time._ — Grady Booch

# Abstraction

_One particular talent stands out among the world-class programmers I’ve known—namely, an ability to move effortlessly between different levels of abstraction._ — Donald Knuth

_The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise._ — Edsger Dijkstra

_Success comes in an emerging set of abstract concepts that makes sense of all the detail. This distillation is a rigorous expression of the particular knowledge that has been found most relevant._ ― Eric Evans

_Abstraction is the elimination of the irrelevant and the amplification of the essential._ ― Robert C. Martin

# Design

_To become experts at managing complexity, we need the following: Modularity, Cohesion, Separation of Concerns, Abstraction, Loose Coupling._ ― David Farley

_[One Page Principle] A (specification, design, procedure, test plan) that will not fit on one page of 8.5-by-1l.1 inch paper cannot be understood._ — Mark Ardis 

_Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships._ — Linus Torvalds

_Should array indices start at 0 or 1? My compromise of 0.5 was rejected without, I thought, proper consideration._ — Stan Kelly-Bootle

_Inside every large program is a small program trying to get out._ — Tony Hoare

_Unix is user-friendly; it's just picky about who its friends are._ — Anonymous

_So much complexity in software comes from trying to make one thing do two things._ — Ryan Singer

_OOP does model the real world! Things at the top of the hierarchy seemingly do nothing but tell those at the bottom what to do._ — @fogus

_All problems in CS can be solved by another level of indirection, except for the problem of too many layers of indirection._ — David Wheeler

_Strive to add function by deleting code._ — Jon Bentley

_The mark of a mature programmer is willingness to throw out code you spent time on when you realize it's pointless._ — Bram Cohen

_One of my most productive days was throwing away 1,000 lines of code._ ― Ken Thompson

_UNIX is basically a simple operating system, but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity._ — Dennis Ritchie

_In protocol design, perfection has been reached not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away._ — Ross Callon in the fantastic RFC 1925

_I have always wished for my computer to be as easy to use as my telephone. My wish has come true because I can no longer figure out how to use my telephone._ — Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++

_There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies, and the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. The first method is far more difficult._ ― C. A. R. Hoare

_Folk wisdom in software development teaches that interfaces shouldn't be unduly influenced by implementations. Writing a test first is a concrete way to achieve this separation._ ― Kent Beck

_The vital detail about the design is captured in the code. A well-written implementation should be transparent, revealing the model underlying it._ ― Eric Evans

# Implementation

_Allocate four digits for the year part of a date: a new millennium is coming._ — David Martin (Published as early as 1985)

_In programming, if someone tells you “you’re overcomplicating it,” they’re either 10 steps behind you or 10 steps ahead of you._ — Andrew Clark

_Whenever possible, steal code._ — Tom Duff

_Eschew clever rules._ — Joe Condon 

_For each desired change, make the change easy (warning: this may be hard), then make the easy change._ — Kent Beck

_... the best programs are the ones written when the programmer is supposed to be working on something else._ — Melinda Varian

_Good Programming is not learned from generalities, but by seeing how significant programs can be made clean, easy to read, easy to maintain and modify, … . Careful study and imitation of good programs leads to better writing._ — Kernighan and Plauger

_There’s nothing more permanent than a temporary hack._ — Kyle Simpson

_The strength of JavaScript is that you can do anything. The weakness is that you will._ — Reg Braithwaite

_Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them._ — Ron Jeffries

_TDD applies a pressure to create code that is objectively “higher quality.” This is irrespective of the talent or experience of the software developer. It doesn’t make bad software developers great, but it does make “bad software developers” better and “great software developers” greater._ ― David Farley

_Legacy code isn't the problem. It's all the cruft and technical debt in the legacy code that's the problem._ ― Jim Humelsine

_The cost of technical debt and cruft is not in their abatement. The cost of technical debt and cruft is having to work around them while they're still in the system._ ― Jim Humelsine, not my original thought, but my phrasing.

# Readable/Comprehensible Code

_Software is like poetry. Most of it probably should not have been written._ — Anonymous

_Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad._ — Cory House

_Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand._ ― Martin Fowler

_Programming is the art of telling another human being what one wants the computer to do._ ― Donald Knuth

_Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute._ ― Donald Knuth

_A procedure should fit on a page._ — David Tribble

_Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares._ — Michael Feathers

_Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live._ — Martin Golding

_Writing software as if we are the only person that ever has to comprehend it is one of the biggest mistakes and false assumptions that can be made._ — Karolina Szczur

_Whenever I have to think to understand what the code is doing, I ask myself if I can refactor the code to make that understanding more immediately apparent._ ― Martin Fowler

_It is not the language that makes programs appear simple. It is the programmer that makes the language appear simple!_ ― Robert C. Martin

_Write code as if you had to support it for the rest of your life._ ― Kevlin Henney

_Well designed and written code doesn't require much maintenance. Software developers are constantly thrust into the poorly designed and written code to fix bugs and add new features. Thus is our curse. We're constantly exposed to bad code but rarely good code._ ― Jim Humelsine

_No matter how slow you are writing clean code, you will always be slower if you make a mess._ — Bob Martin

_All public elements of a design together make up its interface, and the name of each of those elements presents an opportunity to reveal the intention of the design._ ― Eric Evans

_To write clean code, you must first write dirty code and then clean it._ ― Robert C. Martin

_It’s amazing how much cleaner your code looks the third time writing it. First time, hack; Second over-engineer; Third = goldilocks._ ― Aaron Evans

# Prevention

_Rarely is anyone thanked for the work they did to prevent the disaster that didn’t happen._ — Mikko Hypponen

_Some of those firefighters were also the arsonists._ — Dave T., coworker and friend, who whispered this to me at a Department Meeting after several developers were given The Firefighter Award by our Department Head for their heroic efforts in fixing issues in production.

_A good lifeguard never gets wet. A bad lifeguard gets his name in the paper._ — My Red Cross Lifeguard Instructor when I was as teenager

# Documentation

_If the code and the comments disagree, then both are probably wrong._ — Norm Schryer

_Don’t Use a Comment When You Can Use a Function or a Variable._ ― Robert C. Martin

_A common fallacy is to assume authors of incomprehensible code will be able to express themselves clearly in comments._ — Kevlin Henney

_When you see commented-out code, delete it!_ ― Robert C. Martin

_Code never lies, comments sometimes do._ — Ron Jeffries

_A heuristic we follow is that whenever we feel the need to comment something, we write a method instead._ ― Martin Fowler

_Redundant comments are just places to collect lies and misinformation._ ― Robert C. Martin

_If your code needs comments, consider refactoring it so it doesn’t._ ― Kevlin Henney

_Every time you write a comment, you should grimace and feel the failure of your ability of expression._ ― Robert C. Martin

_Comments are like apologies to the next programmer._ ― Unknown

# Testing and Debugging

_Testing can show the presence of bugs, but not their absence!_ — Edsger W. Dijkstra

_Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday’s code._ — Dan Salomon

_If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in._ ― Edsger W. Dijkstra

_Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it._ — Brian Kernighan

_The first step in fixing a broken program is getting it to fail repeatably._ — Tom Duff

_Debugging is like being the detective in a crime movie where you are also the murderer._ — @fortes

_When programmers do their jobs, testers find nothing._ — Bob Martin

_Hardware eventually fails. Software eventually works._ — Michael Hartung

_Our end users are our best and most expensive testers._ — Jim Humelsine

_The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements._ — Brian Kernighan

_Test-driven development is double-entry bookkeeping._ — Bob Martin

_The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do._ — Andrew Singer

_Tests don't break your code; they break your illusions about the quality of that code._ — Maaret Pyhäjärvi

_As soon as you have humans doing repetitive tasks on behalf of computers, they all get together late at night and laugh at you._ — Neal Ford, in the context of repetitive manual vs automated testing

_Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it._ — Donald Knuth

_Testing leads to failure, and failure leads to understanding._ — Burt Rutan

_Write tests until fear is transformed into boredom._ ― Kent Beck

_The unit tests are documents. They describe the lowest-level design of the system._ ― Robert C. Martin

_Rather than apply minutes of suspect reasoning, we can just ask the computer by making the change and running the tests._ ― Kent Beck

_All race conditions, deadlock conditions, and concurrent update problems are due to mutable variables._ ― Robert C. Martin

_The earlier you catch defects, the cheaper they are to fix._ ― David Farley

_Tests are a reflection of the code. If tests are ugly or difficult to write, then the issue resides in the implementation, not the test. Refactor the implementation._ — Jim Humelsine

_If you're good at the debugger it means you spent a lot of time debugging. I don't want you to be good at the debugger._ ― Robert C. Martin

# Performance

_Premature optimization is the root of all evil._ ― Donald Knuth

_The best performance improvement is the transition from the nonworking state to the working state._ — John Ousterhout

_The fastest algorithm can frequently be replaced by one that is almost as fast and much easier to understand._ — Douglas W. Jones 

_Fancy algorithms are slow when n is small, and n is usually small._ — Rob Pike

_The cleaner and nicer the program, the faster it's going to run. And if it doesn't, it'll be easy to make it fast._ — Joshua Bloch
