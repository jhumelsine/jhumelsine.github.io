# Introduction
I began this blog in earnest as a retirement project in the fall of 2023. The blog's [home page](https://jhumelsine.github.io/) lists the entries chronologically from newest to oldest. Blog entries are often part of a series focused upon a theme. The first blog entry of a series is usually an introduction to the series and acts as a landing page to the other blogs in the series. There are crossover reference links to other blog entries as well.

This meta-blog entry organizes the themes of my blog entries. __NOTE:__ This page will be updated as new blog entries are added to existing themes and new themes are introduced.

# AI Notebooks
I have created AI/Google Notebooks for several of my blog series. Each provides an AI interactive experience with some of my central themes. Click on the triangle shaped Play button in the __Studio__ section for an AI generated two-host podcast formatted summary or click on the waving hand button for an interactive session with the AI generated podcast hosts. You can also interact with the generated AI hosts to some degree.

__NOTE:__ I think that a Google account may be required to access the AI/Google Notebooks.

# Software Engineering
A degree in Computer Science has been the initial exposure to software for many developers; however, Computer Science is not the same as Software Engineering.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is a core software engineering concept, and it's more challenging to describe abstraction concretely than I originally thought.

* [What is Abstraction?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/10/30/abstraction.html) - An introduction to Abstraction.
* [Cohesion and Coupling](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/07/cohesion-coupling.html) - My first attempt to describe Cohesion and Coupling.
* [Cohesion and Coupling - Take 2](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/22/coupling-and-cohesion-2.html) - My second attempt to describe Cohesion and Coupling.
* [What is Cohesive Construction?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/27/abstraction-cohesion.html) - How to configure cohesive abstractions consistently.
* [Getting the Right Abstraction is Hard](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/22/right-abstraction-is-hard.html) - How I adjusted the abstraction in a design I inherited.

See: [Abstraction AI Agent](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/94884f00-c719-471f-87f6-9225b67922be?_gl=1*1dhb7x1*_ga*NjM2MjkwMzI5LjE3NDg1MzE4MjM.*_ga_W0LDH41ZCB*czE3NDk1NjA5MjQkbzUkZzEkdDE3NDk1NjEzMjQkajYwJGwwJGgw)

## SE Miscellaneous
* [Bumper Sticker Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/12/15/bumper-sticker-computer-science-software-engineering.html) - I think this is my favorite entry.
* [My Design Process](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/05/28/design-process.html) - Everyone has their own way to approach design problems. This entry describes mine.

# Design Patterns
Design Patterns changed how I approach software. I feel that every Software Engineer should have some degree of competence and comfort with design patterns.

## Design Pattern Foundations
Design Patterns are not technically challenging, but they do require a slight paradigm shift in thinking. These blog entries lay some foundations toward that shift in thinking.

* [Are you a cook or a chef?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/21/knock-knock-whos-there.html) - Are you following the recipe or creating something new?
* [Rules of the Game](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/24/its-your-move.html) - Do you know more than just the rules of the game? Do you know strategy and tactics to win the game?
* [Problem Solvers](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/26/problem-solvers.html) - We solve problems, usually in the form of code.
* [Design Patterns are Everywhere](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/28/wheels.html) - Design Patterns are not limited to Software Engineering. They are ubiquitous in most domains.
* [Toolbox](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/29/toolbox.html) - Design Patterns are tools in your toolbox. Like most tools, we have mastered them when we not only know when to use them, but when not to use them.
* [Parts is Parts](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/01/parts-is-parts.html) - Most Object-Oriented Design Patterns are different combinations of the same set of OO constructs.
* [Design Pattern Principles](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/06/design-pattern-principles.html) - There are only two Design Pattern Principles. Understanding them will help in understanding the underlying structures that reappear in Design Patterns.

See: [Design Pattern Foundations AI Agent](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/ec8ed593-cd93-4a65-8615-2233bef3d910?_gl=1*u5eebw*_ga*NjM2MjkwMzI5LjE3NDg1MzE4MjM.*_ga_W0LDH41ZCB*czE3NDk1NjA5MjQkbzUkZzAkdDE3NDk1NjA5MjQkajYwJGwwJGgw)

## Essential Design Patterns
The Seven [Essential Design Patterns](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/07/essential-design-patterns.html) are the design patterns that will be used repeatedly in designs. They are the hammer and screwdriver of a software developers design pattern toolbox.

* [Command](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/18/command-design-pattern.html) - Objectify a function so that it becomes a first-class citizen in an Object-Oriented paradigm.
* [Strategy](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/21/strategy-design-pattern.html) - A variant of Command with multiple implementations for an interface.
* [Template Method](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/26/template-method-design-pattern.html) - Similar to Strategy, except the interface is replaced with an abstract base class, which houses the implementation for common behavior that applies in all cases.
* [Adapter](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/29/adapter-design-pattern.html) - A translation helper class that allows other classes to interact indirectly when they cannot interact directly due to different protocols and/or method signatures.
* [Façade](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/03/facade-design-pattern.html) - Similar to Adapter in concept, but rather than performing basic translation, it shields the client application of its dependency upon a particularly nasty or complex class or set of classes.
* [Factory](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/07/factory-design-patterns.html) - Allows an application to acquire an object reference without knowing class type and without having to call a `new()` constructor directly.
* [Dependency Injection](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/09/dependency-injection-design-pattern.html) - Removes all dependency resolution from an application by transfering that responsibility to another entity whose sole responsibility is to configure and resolve object references for the application.

See: [Essential Design Patterns AI Agent](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/a4db6342-c117-4664-b0ed-1aa79d720db7?_gl=1*1dhb7x1*_ga*NjM2MjkwMzI5LjE3NDg1MzE4MjM.*_ga_W0LDH41ZCB*czE3NDk1NjA5MjQkbzUkZzEkdDE3NDk1NjEzMjQkajYwJGwwJGgw)

## Hexagonal Architecture AKA Ports and Adapters Design
The Hexagonal Architecture (AKA Ports and Adapters) is a design that all software developers should know.
It showcases how different Essential Design Patterns can work as a cohesive design.

The [Hexagonal Architecture Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/24/hexagonal-architecture-introduction.html) introduces the design and provides an index to the other blog entries in the series, which includes what I feel is one of my most important blog entries, [Dependency and Knowledge Management](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/11/03/hexagonal-architecture-dependencies-knowledge.html), which focuses upon why HexArch/P&A works. I feel that dependency and knowledge management applies to all OO based designs, and not just within the context of Hexagonal Architecture.

See: [Hexagonal Architecture AKA Ports and Adapters AI Agent](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/224c31b5-fac9-441a-9886-8ed071bf1d52?_gl=1*1dhb7x1*_ga*NjM2MjkwMzI5LjE3NDg1MzE4MjM.*_ga_W0LDH41ZCB*czE3NDk1NjA5MjQkbzUkZzEkdDE3NDk1NjEzMjQkajYwJGwwJGgw)

## Composable Design Patterns
The [Composable Design Patterns](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/01/03/composable-design-patterns-basic-concepts.html) focus upon behavior emerging from the composition of objects and their interaction in a structured formation rather than implemented within an individual class.

This series features the composable design patterns: [Proxy](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/01/proxy-design-pattern.html), [Decorator](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/08/decorator-design-pattern.html), [Chain of Responsibility](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/20/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern.html), [Composite](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/27/composite-design-pattern.html), [Specification](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/03/06/specification-design-pattern.html) and [Interpreter](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/03/12/interpreter-design-pattern-introduction.html).

See: [Composable Design Patterns AI Agent](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/bc19b872-144e-4218-8622-023e963becdf?_gl=1*1dhb7x1*_ga*NjM2MjkwMzI5LjE3NDg1MzE4MjM.*_ga_W0LDH41ZCB*czE3NDk1NjA5MjQkbzUkZzEkdDE3NDk1NjEzMjQkajYwJGwwJGgw)

### Interpreter Design Pattern
The [Interpreter](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/03/12/interpreter-design-pattern-introduction.html) required its own series.

Interpreter allows software developers to design and implement their own Domain-Specific Languages. Interpreter is not just the pinnacle of Composable Design Patterns, but I feel it shares the top spot of all design patterns along with the Visitor Design Pattern.

Interpreter is not a difficult pattern to design or implement, but it's a difficult pattern comprehend. Interpreter required multiple blog entries to do it justice. Its [introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/03/12/interpreter-design-pattern-introduction.html) provides a summary of the pattern as well as a landing page for the subsequent blog entries that provide additional details, such as [Domain-Specific Languages](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/03/18/interpreter-design-pattern-dsls.html), [Grammars](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/04/02/interpreter-design-pattern-grammars.html), [Implementation](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/04/17/interpreter-design-pattern-implementation.html) and a [Production Example](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/05/14/interpreter-design-pattern-production.html).

See: [Interpreter Design Pattern AI Agent](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/452441d7-f9d9-4a31-9084-a02621271099?_gl=1*1dhb7x1*_ga*NjM2MjkwMzI5LjE3NDg1MzE4MjM.*_ga_W0LDH41ZCB*czE3NDk1NjA5MjQkbzUkZzEkdDE3NDk1NjEzMjQkajYwJGwwJGgw)

# Automated Testing
I didn't appreciate automated testing until late in my career. My automated testing series begins with my [Conversion](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/06/07/unit-test-convert.html) from automated testing non-believer to almost a zealot. The series grew larger than I imagined. I ended up writing a short book on the topic.

# Large Language Models and Generative AI
AI has become a major topic since late 2022 with the introduction of ChatGPT among others. I learn a bit more about how to use them almost daily.

See: [Large Language Models and Generative AI AI Agent](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/36b181b7-07b1-443e-86d3-038adc3400ed?_gl=1*1dhb7x1*_ga*NjM2MjkwMzI5LjE3NDg1MzE4MjM.*_ga_W0LDH41ZCB*czE3NDk1NjA5MjQkbzUkZzEkdDE3NDk1NjEzMjQkajYwJGwwJGgw)

## LLM/GenAI Introduction
[LLM/GenAI Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/18/llm-genai.html) - Like it or not, the AI Genie is out of the  bottle.

## Prompt Engineering Patterns
Prompt Engineering Patterns are the key to getting the best results from Generative AI. These blogs present a few patterns I learned via online courses.

* [Prompt Engineering Patterns 1](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/25/prompt-engineering-patterns1.html)
* [Prompt Engineering Patterns 2](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/10/18/prompt-engineering-patterns2.html)

# True Stories
The following blog entries feature a few __True Stories__, or maybe they should be called: __True Confessions__. I try to include personal experiences where I can in my blog entries. Sometimes story is the entire blog entry. Sometimes it's just a part of the blog entry.

I keep my employer and others anonymous. If I do mention someone by name, I only use their first name, and I get their permission.
