# Introduction
I began this blog in ernest as a retirement project in the fall of 2023. The blog's [home page](https://jhumelsine.github.io/) lists the entries chronologically from newest to oldest. Blog entries are often part of a series focused upon a core theme. The first blog entry of a series usually an introduction to the series and acts as a landing page to the other blogs in the series. There are crossover reference links to other blog entries as well.

This meta-blog entry organizes the themes of my blog entries.

# Software Engineering
A degree in Computer Science has been the initial exposure to software for many developers; however, Computer Science is not the same as Softare Engineering.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is a core software engineering concept, and it's more challenging to describe abstraction concretely that I originally thought.

* [What is Abstraction?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/10/30/abstraction.html)
* [Cohesion and Coupling](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/07/cohesion-coupling.html)
* [Cohesion and Coupling - Take 2](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/22/coupling-and-cohesion-2.html)
* [What is Cohesive Construction?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/27/abstraction-cohesion.html)
* [Getting the Right Abstraction is Hard](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/22/right-abstraction-is-hard.html)

## SE Miscellaneous
* [Bumper Sticker Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/12/15/bumper-sticker-computer-science-software-engineering.html) - I think this is my favorite entry.
* [My Design Process](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/05/28/design-process.html) - Everyone has a favorite way to approach design problems. This entry describes mine.

# Design Patterns
Design Patterns changed how I approach software. I feel that every Software Engineer should have some degree of competence and comfort with design patterns.

## Design Pattern Foundations
Design Patterns are not technically challenging, but they do require a slight paradigm shift in thinking. These blog entries lay some foundations toward that shift in thinking.

* [Are you a cook or a chef?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/21/knock-knock-whos-there.html) - Are you following the recipe or creating something new?
* [Rules of the Game](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/24/its-your-move.html) - Do you know more than just the rules of the game? Do you know strategy and tactics to win the game?
* [Problem Solvers](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/26/problem-solvers.html) - We solve problems, usually in the form of code.
* [Design Patterns are Everywhere](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/28/wheels.html) - Design Patterns are not limited to Software Engineering. They are ubiquitous in most domains.
* [Toolbox](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/29/toolbox.html) - Design Patterns are tools in your toolbox. Like most tools, we have mastered them when we not only know when to use them, but when not to use them.
* [Parts is Parts](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/01/parts-is-parts.html) - Most Object-Oriented Design Patterns are different combinations of the same set of OO concepts.
* [Design Pattern Principles](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/06/design-pattern-principles.html) - There are only two Design Pattern Princples. Understanding them will help in understanding the underlying structures that reappear in Design Patterns.

## Essential Design Patterns
The Seven Essential Design Patterns are the design patterns that will used repeatedly in designs. They are the hammer and screwdriver of a software developers design pattern toolbox.

[Essential Design Patterns](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/07/essential-design-patterns.html) - This introduces the essential design patterns, such as: [Strategy](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/21/strategy-design-pattern.html), [Template Method](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/26/template-method-design-pattern.html), [Adapter](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/29/adapter-design-pattern.html), etc.

## Hexagonal Architecture AKA Ports and Adapters Design
The Hexagonal Architecture (AKA Ports and Adapters) is a design that all software developers should know.
It showcases how different Essential Design Patterns can work as a cohesive design.

[Hexagonal Architecture Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/24/hexagonal-architecture-introduction.html) - This series includes what I feel is one of the most important blog entries, [Dependency and Knowledge Management](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/11/03/hexagonal-architecture-dependencies-knowledge.html), which focuses upon why HexArch/P&A works, but I feel that it applies to all OO based designs.

## Composable Design Patterns
The Composable Design Patterns focus upon behavior emerging from the composition of objects rather than implemented withn an individual class.

[Composable Design Patterns](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/01/03/composable-design-patterns-basic-concepts.html) - This introduces the essential design patterns, such as: [Decorator](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/08/decorator-design-pattern.html), [Chain of Responsibility](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/20/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern.html), [Composite](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/27/composite-design-pattern.html), etc.

### Interpreter Design Pattern
Interpreter is not just the pinnacle of Composable Design Patterns, but I feel it shares the top spot of all design patterns along with the Visitor Design Pattern.
Interpreter is not a difficult pattern to design or implement, but it's a difficult pattern comprehend.

[Interpreter Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/03/12/interpreter-design-pattern-introduction.html) - Interpreter required multiple blog entries to do it justice. This introduction provides a summary of the pattern as well as a landing page for the subsequent blog entries that provide additional details, such as [Domain-Specific Languages](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/03/18/interpreter-design-pattern-dsls.html), [Grammars](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/04/02/interpreter-design-pattern-grammars.html) and [Implementation](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/04/17/interpreter-design-pattern-implementation.html).

# Automated Testing
I didn't appreciate automated testing until late in my career. It became a major topic for the summer of 2024, and there's more content to come.

[Automated Testing Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/06/07/unit-test-convert.html) - This the introduces automated testing covering topics such as: [Attributes of Effective Unit Tests](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/06/14/unit-test-attributes.html), [Test Doubles](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/02/test-doubles.html) and [Test-Driven Development](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/15/tdd.html)/[Behavior-Driven Development](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/08/08/bdd.html). There are also a couple true test stories featuring [Suril](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/08/suril-semaphore.html) and [Yuri](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/22/yuri-evaluator.html).

# Large Language Models and Generative AI
AI has become a major topic since late 2022 with the introduction of ChatGPT among others.

## LLM/GenAI Introduction
[LLM/GenAI Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/18/llm-genai.html) - Like it or not, the AI Genie is out of the  bottle.

## Prompt Engineering Patterns
Prompt Engineering Patterns are the key to getting the best results from Generative AI. These blogs present a few patterns I learned via online courses.

* [Patterns 1](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/25/prompt-engineering-patterns1.html)
* [Patterns 2](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/10/18/prompt-engineering-patterns2.html)

# Miscellaneous
This is for blog entries that were one-offs, and weren't part of series

* [Job Loss](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/08/11/jobsearch.html) - Software Engineering has been a great career for me, but it wasn't without a few bumps in the road. I wrote this blog when others I knew in the industry were running into the same bumpy road in their careers.
