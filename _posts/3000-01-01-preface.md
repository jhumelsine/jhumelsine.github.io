# Introduction
I began this blog in earnest as a retirement project in the fall of 2023. The blog's [home page](https://jhumelsine.github.io/) lists the entries chronologically from newest to oldest. Blog entries are often part of a series focused upon a theme. The first blog entry of a series is usually an introduction to the series and acts as a landing page to the other blogs in the series. There are crossover reference links to other blog entries as well.

This meta-blog entry organizes the themes of my blog entries. __NOTE:__ This page will be updated as new blog entries are added to existing themes and new themes are introduced.

# Software Engineering
A degree in Computer Science has been the initial exposure to software for many developers; however, Computer Science is not the same as Software Engineering.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is a core software engineering concept, and it's more challenging to describe abstraction concretely that I originally thought.

* [What is Abstraction?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/10/30/abstraction.html) - An introduction to Abstraction.
* [Cohesion and Coupling](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/07/cohesion-coupling.html) - My first attempt to describe Cohesion and Coupling.
* [Cohesion and Coupling - Take 2](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/22/coupling-and-cohesion-2.html) - My second attempt to describe Cohesion and Coupling.
* [What is Cohesive Construction?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/27/abstraction-cohesion.html) - How to configure cohesive abstractions consistently.
* [Getting the Right Abstraction is Hard](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/22/right-abstraction-is-hard.html) - How I adjusted the abstraction in a design I inherited.

## SE Miscellaneous
* [Bumper Sticker Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/12/15/bumper-sticker-computer-science-software-engineering.html) - I think this is my favorite entry.
* [My Design Process](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/05/28/design-process.html) - Everyone has their own way to approach design problems. This entry describes mine.

# Design Patterns
Design Patterns changed how I approach software. I feel that every Software Engineer should have some degree of competence and comfort with design patterns.

## Design Pattern Foundations
Design Patterns are not technically challenging, but they do require a slight paradigm shift in thinking. These blog entries lay some foundations toward that shift in thinking.

* [Are you a cook or a chef?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/21/knock-knock-whos-there.html) - Are you following the recipe or creating something new?
* [Rules of the Game](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/24/its-your-move.html) - Do you know more than just the rules of the game? Do you know strategy and tactics to win the game?
* [Problem Solvers](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/26/problem-solvers.html) - We solve problems, usually in the form of code.
* [Design Patterns are Everywhere](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/28/wheels.html) - Design Patterns are not limited to Software Engineering. They are ubiquitous in most domains.
* [Toolbox](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/29/toolbox.html) - Design Patterns are tools in your toolbox. Like most tools, we have mastered them when we not only know when to use them, but when not to use them.
* [Parts is Parts](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/01/parts-is-parts.html) - Most Object-Oriented Design Patterns are different combinations of the same set of OO constructs.
* [Design Pattern Principles](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/06/design-pattern-principles.html) - There are only two Design Pattern Principles. Understanding them will help in understanding the underlying structures that reappear in Design Patterns.

## Essential Design Patterns
[Essential Design Patterns](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/07/essential-design-patterns.html)

The Seven Essential Design Patterns are the design patterns that will be used repeatedly in designs. They are the hammer and screwdriver of a software developers design pattern toolbox.

This series features the essential design patterns, such as: [Strategy](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/21/strategy-design-pattern.html), [Template Method](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/26/template-method-design-pattern.html), [Adapter](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/29/adapter-design-pattern.html), etc.

## Hexagonal Architecture AKA Ports and Adapters Design
[Hexagonal Architecture Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/24/hexagonal-architecture-introduction.html)

The Hexagonal Architecture (AKA Ports and Adapters) is a design that all software developers should know.
It showcases how different Essential Design Patterns can work as a cohesive design.

The Hexagonal Architecture series includes what I feel is one of my most important blog entries, [Dependency and Knowledge Management](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/11/03/hexagonal-architecture-dependencies-knowledge.html), which focuses upon why HexArch/P&A works. I feel that it applies to all OO based designs.

## Composable Design Patterns
[Composable Design Patterns](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/01/03/composable-design-patterns-basic-concepts.html)

The Composable Design Patterns focus upon behavior emerging from the composition of objects rather than implemented within an individual class.

This series features the composable design patterns, such as: [Decorator](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/08/decorator-design-pattern.html), [Chain of Responsibility](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/20/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern.html), [Composite](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/27/composite-design-pattern.html), etc.

### Interpreter Design Pattern
[Interpreter Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/03/12/interpreter-design-pattern-introduction.html)

Interpreter allows software developers to design and implement their own Domain-Specific Languages. Interpreter is not just the pinnacle of Composable Design Patterns, but I feel it shares the top spot of all design patterns along with the Visitor Design Pattern.

Interpreter is not a difficult pattern to design or implement, but it's a difficult pattern comprehend. Interpreter required multiple blog entries to do it justice. This introduction provides a summary of the pattern as well as a landing page for the subsequent blog entries that provide additional details, such as [Domain-Specific Languages](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/03/18/interpreter-design-pattern-dsls.html), [Grammars](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/04/02/interpreter-design-pattern-grammars.html) and [Implementation](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/04/17/interpreter-design-pattern-implementation.html).

# Automated Testing
[Automated Testing Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/06/07/unit-test-convert.html)

I didn't appreciate automated testing until late in my career.

The automated testing series covers topics such as: [Attributes of Effective Unit Tests](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/06/14/unit-test-attributes.html), [Test Doubles](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/02/test-doubles.html), [Test-Driven Development](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/15/tdd.html)/[Behavior-Driven Development](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/08/08/bdd.html) and [Working Effectively with Legacy Code](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2025/03/24/legacy-code.html). There are also a couple true test stories featuring [Suril](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/08/suril-semaphore.html) and [Yuri](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/22/yuri-evaluator.html).

# Large Language Models and Generative AI
AI has become a major topic since late 2022 with the introduction of ChatGPT among others.

## LLM/GenAI Introduction
[LLM/GenAI Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/18/llm-genai.html) - Like it or not, the AI Genie is out of the  bottle.

## Prompt Engineering Patterns
Prompt Engineering Patterns are the key to getting the best results from Generative AI. These blogs present a few patterns I learned via online courses.

* [Prompt Engineering Patterns 1](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/25/prompt-engineering-patterns1.html)
* [Prompt Engineering Patterns 2](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/10/18/prompt-engineering-patterns2.html)

# True Stories
The following blog entries feature a few __True Stories__, or maybe they should be called: __True Confessions__. I try to include personal experiences where I can in my blog entries. Sometimes story is the entire blog entry. Sometimes it's just a part of the blog entry.

I keep my employer and others anonymous. If I do mention someone by name, I only use their first name, and I get their permission.

* [What is UML and why you may want to care](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2021/06/22/uml.html) - When [I realized](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2021/06/22/uml.html#when-i-realized-how-to-use-them), in an ___Aha!___ moment, that OMT, the predecessor of UML, is more than just a design tool.
* [It's Your Move](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/24/its-your-move.html) - When I realized that software engineering was more than just knowing the rules of a programming language.
* [Getting the Right Abstraction is Hard](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/22/right-abstraction-is-hard.html) - Where I had one of my [first experiences](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/22/right-abstraction-is-hard.html#fiber-optic-switch) of working with someone else's code and realizing that it could be designed better.
* [Façade Design Pattern](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/03/facade-design-pattern.html) - Where I encapsulated a really [nasty API](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/03/facade-design-pattern.html#i-have-to-implement-how-many-classes) away from the rest of my codebase.
* [Dependency Injection](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/09/dependency-injection-design-pattern.html) - Where tightly coupled code limited my team's testing abilities.
* [Hexagonal Architecture – Adapter Flexibility](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/11/30/hexagonal-architecture-adapter-flexibility.html) - Where adopting [Hexagonal Architecture and an Adapter Dispatcher](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/11/30/hexagonal-architecture-adapter-flexibility.html#inspired-by-true-events) provided the flexibility we needed to solve a rather challenging design problem.
* [Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/20/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern.html) - Where a Chain of Responsibility design solved a problem of different configurations of [Address Books](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/02/20/chain-of-responsibility-design-pattern.html#use-case--address-book).
* [Interpreter Design Pattern – Production Example](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/05/14/interpreter-design-pattern-production.html) - Where I created a Domain-Specific Language, even when that was not my original intent.

* [The Conversion of a Unit Test Denier](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/06/07/unit-test-convert.html) ... or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Unit Testing.
* [Suril, the Semaphore and Me](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/08/suril-semaphore.html) - How I learned the true meaning of Software Under Test.
* [Yuri, the Programming Assignment and Me](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/22/yuri-evaluator.html) - When I indoctrinated a young mind with TDD.
* [Losing Your Job Stinks](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/08/11/jobsearch.html) - Where I describe my unemployment experience during a down market after the dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s.
* [Testing Concerns](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/08/test-concerns.html) - Where I list the lessons I learned when I was on the [QA team](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/09/08/test-concerns.html#manual-test-code).
* [Abstraction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/10/30/abstraction.html) - Where I describe the conversation, I had with a mentee at my college alma mater, which inspired this blog.
* [What Is Cohesive Abstraction?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/27/abstraction-cohesion.html) - Where I describe my experience with [Safety Critial Code](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/27/abstraction-cohesion.html#safety-critical) as well as provide [A Cautionary Tale](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/27/abstraction-cohesion.html#a-cautionary-tale), which darn near cost me my job.
* [A House Divided Against Itself Will Not Stand](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2025/03/07/house-divided.html) - Where I resolve the conflict between [My Design Process](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/05/28/design-process.html) and [Test-Driven Development](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/07/15/tdd.html#test-driven-development) blog entries.

# Miscellaneous
This is for blog entries that were one-offs, and weren't part of series

* [Job Loss](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/08/11/jobsearch.html) - Software Engineering has been a great career for me, but it wasn't without a few bumps in the road. I wrote this blog when others I knew in the industry were running into the same bumpy road in their careers.
