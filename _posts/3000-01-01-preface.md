# Introduction
I began this blog in ernest as a retirement project in the fall of 2023. The landing page for the blogs lists them from newest to oldest, which for the most part is their only organization as a whole. There is some additional internal organization, such as the first blog entry of a series usually has an index to the other blogs in the series. There are also crossover reference links to other blog entries.

However, there's no overall Preface, Primer or Table of Contents for the Blog as a whole. This meta-blog entry will address that.
