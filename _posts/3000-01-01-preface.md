# Introduction
I began this blog in ernest as a retirement project in the fall of 2023. The blog's [home page](https://jhumelsine.github.io/) lists the entries chronologically from newest to oldest. Blog entries are often part of a series focused upon a core theme. The first blog entry of a series usually an introduction to the series and acts as a landing page to the other blogs in the series. There are crossover reference links to other blog entries as well.

This meta-blog entry organizes the themes of my blog entries. I will adjust it as the blog evolves.

# Software Engineering
A degree in Computer Science has been the initial exposure to software for many developers; however, Computer Science is not the same as Softare Engineering.

## Abstraction
Abstraction is a core software engineering concept, and more challenging to describe abstraction concretely that I originally thought.

* [What is Abstraction?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/10/30/abstraction.html)
* [Cohesion and Coupling](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/07/cohesion-coupling.html)
* [Cohesion and Coupling - Take 2](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/22/coupling-and-cohesion-2.html)
* [What is Cohesive Construction?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/11/27/abstraction-cohesion.html)
* [The Right Abstraction is Hard](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/22/right-abstraction-is-hard.html)

## SE Miscellaneous
* [Bumper Sticker Computer Science and Software Engineering](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/12/15/bumper-sticker-computer-science-software-engineering.html) - I think this is my favorite entry.
* [My Design Process](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/05/28/design-process.html) - Everyone has a favorite way to approach design problems. This entry describes mine.

# Design Patterns
Design Patterns changed how I approach software. I feel that every Software Engineer should have some degree of competence and comfort with design patterns.

## Design Pattern Foundations
Design Patterns are not technically challenging, but they do require a slight paradigm shift in thinking. These blog entries lay some foundations toward that shift in thinking.

* [Are you a cook or a chef?](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/21/knock-knock-whos-there.html) - Are you following the recipe or creating something new?
* [Rules of the Game](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/24/its-your-move.html) - Do you know more than just the rules of the game? Do you know strategy and tactics to win the game?
* [Problem Solvers](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/26/problem-solvers.html) - We don't write code. We solve problems.
* [Design Patterns are Everywhere](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/28/wheels.html) - Design Patterns are not limited to Software Engineering. They are ubiquitous in most domains.
* [Toolbox](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/29/toolbox.html) - Design Patterns are tools in your toolbox. Like most tools, we master them when we not only know when to use them, but when not to use them.
* [Parts is Parts](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/08/29/toolbox.html) - Most[Object=Oriented Design Patterns are different combinations of the same set of OO concepts.
* [Design Pattern Principles](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/06/design-pattern-principles.html) - There are only two Design Pattern Princples. Understanding them will help in understanding the underlying structures that reappear in the different patterns.

## Essential Design Patterns
This is the introduction and landing page for what I consider the Seven Essential Design Patterns. They are the hammer and screwdriver of a software developers design pattern toolbox.

[Essential Design Patterns](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/09/07/essential-design-patterns.html)

## Hexagonal Architecture AKA Ports and Adapters Design
This is the introduction and landing page for the Hexagonal Architecture (AKA Ports and Adapters) blog series.
Not only is Hexagonal Architecture/Ports&Adapters a design that all software developers should know, but it's really a pattern of the essential design patterns.

[Hexagonal Architecture Introduction](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2023/10/24/hexagonal-architecture-introduction.html)

## Composable Design Patterns
This is the introduction and landing page for the Composable Design Patterns. They focus upon behavior emerging from the composition of objects often organized as Lists or Trees.

[Composable Design Patterns](https://jhumelsine.github.io/2024/01/03/composable-design-patterns-basic-concepts.html)

Interpreter resides not only at the pinnacle of Composable Design Patterns, but at the entire set of Design Patterns.
It is not a difficult pattern to design or implement, but it's a difficult pattern comprehend.
Though this page is part of the Composable set of Design Patterns, Interpreter needed more description. Therefore, this page is also an introduction and landing page for the Interpreter Design Pattern.

# Automated Testing
