I began this blog in ernest as a retirement project in the fall of 2023. The landing page for the blogs lists them from newest to oldest, which for the most part is their only organization as a whole. There is some additional internal organization, such as the first blog entry of a series usually has an index to the other blogs in the series. There are also crossover reference links to other blog entries.
