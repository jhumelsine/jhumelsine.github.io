**Knock, Knock … Who’s There?**

[Gordon Elliot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Elliott_(journalist)) hosted a TV show on the Food Network in the 1990s called [Gordon Elliot’s Door Knock Dinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_Knock_Dinners). Most episodes followed the same pattern:
* Gordon and a world class chef would knock on someone’s front door with the following offer: The chef would cook dinner for the family, but with one constraint – the chef could only use ingredients currently in the home. The offer was usually accepted by a stay-at-home housewife and/or mother.
* The show progressed as the chef, Gordon and the wife scrambled through the house looking for any useful ingredients from leftovers in the fridge to a frozen leg of lamb in the garage freezer.
* Once the scavenger hunt was over, scenes alternated between the chef narrating what he or she is trying to prepare, and Gordon interview the wife in a separate room.
* In the last ten minutes or so, her husband would return from a day at the office with a dazed and confused look on his face as a television crew camped out at his house.
* The final scene was the dinner reveal where the chef served the family always with rave reviews for the meal.
<p>The family was often shocked with the caliber of the meal. A meal like that had come out of their kitchen, but how? Was the wife a bad cook? Probably not. She may have been an excellent cook. But why was she surprised by a meal for which she had all the ingredients?</p>
<p>She may have been a great cook and could follow any recipe well with the desired outcome. But she wasn’t a chef. Chefs don’t follow recipes. Chefs create meals. Watch any competitive cooking show on television, even one featuring children. They never consult recipes.</p>
<p></p>Chefs understand how food works. They know flavors, textures, and techniques. These building blocks allow them to design a meal with the resources at their disposal. They are not constrained by a recipe.</p>
<p>Becoming a chef requires expertise that requires additional training and/or experience. Chefs must devote resources to learn these building blocks.</p>
<p>Many software developers are good “cooks.” They can follow software recipes. But how well do they understand the building blocks to become software chefs?</p>
<p>Just as a chef knows flavors, textures and techniques, a software chef knows data structures, algorithms, and design patterns. These provide the building blocks to design a software product or feature with the resources at one’s disposal. Developers must devote resources to learn these building blocks to become software chefs.</p>
